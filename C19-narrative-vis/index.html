        <h3>About Covid-19 Stringency Index</h3>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">August 1, 2020 by <a href="#">Akhmad Rahadian Hutomo</a></p>

        <p>The <strong>Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) </strong> systematically collects information on several different common policy responses that governments 
          have taken to respond to the pandemic on 17 indicators such as school closures and travel restrictions. It now has data from more than 160 countries. </p>

        <div class="p-4 mb-3 bg-light rounded">
        <p class="font-italic"> <Strong>Notes</Strong></p>
          <p>These indices simply record the number and strictness of government policies, and should not be interpreted as ‘scoring’ the appropriateness 
          or effectiveness of a country’s response. A higher position in an index does not necessarily mean that a country's response is ‘better’ than others 
          lower on the index.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
   
        <h3>Key Countries Stringency Index</h3>
        <p>This scene is to explore the difference between country governments in responding to COVID-19 Cases. The red lines represents changes in stringency index over the course of 
          February to June 2020. </p>
          <p>An increase in the line indicates government takes stricter lockdown approach, <i>vice versa</i>.  The inclines also shows how drastic the changes made over time. There 
            are 15 countries picked by the author, to visualize the difference of the stringency index over time.</p>

            <P>The original stringency index records the strictness of ‘lockdown style’ policies that primarily restrict people’s behaviour. Later, the index also 
            includes an overall government response index, which records how the response of governments has varied over all indicators in the database, becoming 
            stronger or weaker over the course of the outbreak. The index also measures containment and health index which combines ‘lockdown’ restrictions and 
            closures with measures such as testing policy and contact tracing, short term investment in healthcare, as well investments in vaccine.</p>
        
        <!--Scene 2 Visualisation Script-->
        <div id="scene-1"></div>
        <script src="scene-1.js"></script>
        
        <p>As we may observe, each countries has different approach in responding to the pandemic. There are some general pattern we may observe from this visualisations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Countries that takes a gradual increase of lockdown, as represented by Singapore and South Korea. </li>
          <li> Countries that takes a drastic approach to lockdown, which may indicates sudden lockdown as indicated in Italy, India and Honduras. </li>
          <li> Some countries takes lighter approach to lockdown, such as Japan and Sweden.</li>
          <li> There's also some pattern where lockdown was gradually reduced as indicated in Australia and New Zealand.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will take a look closely at some countries, namely <strong>Australia</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, and <strong>Japan</strong> and observe the new cases reported daily and its correlation to this Stringency Index</p>


        <h6> Data Source</h6>
        <p>Collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by Our World in Data. Data is updated daily and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, and testing, as 
          well as other variables of potential interest, in this narrative, we take a look at stringency index.</p>
