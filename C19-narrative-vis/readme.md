# Does COVID-19 lockdown measures correlates with new cases?

## About Stringency Index
The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) systematically collects information on several different common policy responses that governments have taken to respond to the pandemic on 17 indicators such as school closures and travel restrictions. It now has data from more than 160 countries. 

the original stringency index records the strictness of ‘lockdown style’ policies that primarily restrict people’s behaviour. Later, the index also includes an overall government response index, which records how the response of governments has varied over all indicators in the database, becoming stronger or weaker over the course of the outbreak. The index also measures containment and health index which combines ‘lockdown’ restrictions and closures with measures such as testing policy and contact tracing, short term investment in healthcare, as well investments in vaccine.

Note that these indices simply record the number and strictness of government policies, and should not be interpreted as ‘scoring’ the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country’s response. A higher position in an index does not necessarily mean that a country's response is ‘better’ than others lower on the index.

### Data Source
Collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by Our World in Data. Data is updated daily and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, and testing, as well as other variables of potential interest, in this narrative, we take a look at stringency index.
